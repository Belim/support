# ðŸŽ‰ Thank You So Much for Your Support!

Hey there!  
If youâ€™ve landed on this page, it probably means you just made a donation â€” and I want to say one thing loud and clear:

## ðŸ’› **THANK YOU. Really.**

Whether it was for **Flyby11**, **CrapFixer**, or just to support what I do in general â€” your contribution *truly* means a lot.  
Maintaining these tools takes time, energy, and way too much coffee â˜• â€” so your help keeps this whole thing alive and growing.

This isn't a company, thereâ€™s no team behind the scenes â€” itâ€™s just one person building and maintaining these projects with passion (and a bit of chaos). So, thank you for being part of that.

## ðŸš€ What's Next?

Your donation helps me:
- Keep projects like **Flyby11** and **CrapFixer** alive and updated
- Cover infrastructure and testing costs
- Stay motivated during those long coding nights

And most of all, it reminds me **why** I started all this in the first place.

## ðŸŽµ Behind every piece of code, there's a human story.

If you're curious why I started all these tools in the first place â€” and why CrapFixer is different â€” there's a very personal story behind it all.
